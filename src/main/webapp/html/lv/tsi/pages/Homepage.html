				IMDb started in 1990 as a hobby project by an international group of movie and TV fans (see history). IMDb is now the world’s most popular and authoritative source for movie, TV and celebrity content. We offer a searchable database of more than 100 million data items including more than 2 million movies, TV and entertainment programs and more than 4 million cast and crew members. Using IMDb (www.imdb.com) is free for non-commercial use. The site is supported by revenues from our advertisers. If you would like to support our efforts, we ask that you visit our advertisers by clicking on their banners at the top of our pages, and when you're in the market for books, videos, music, or any of the other products sold by Amazon.com, you'll use our links to visit them and shop for those items. If you work in the entertainment industry, you can probably find even more useful information at our subscription site, IMDb Pro (IMDbPro.com), an expanded version of the Internet Movie Database offering additional features specifically aimed towards film industry professionals, including the ability to post a Resume, Photos and Demo Reels on the site. A paid subscription is required for ongoing use of IMDb Pro, but you can get a free trial if you want to try it out first.
